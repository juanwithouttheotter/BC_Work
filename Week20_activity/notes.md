# React state

--Know the difference between functional and class
## The Functional component 
* uses the useState function
* takes in props
* uses react hooks

## The Class component
* extends the react class component and must have a render function.
* useState hooks must be used within a method and would be redundant. 



## Context
* create context *reactCreateContext*
* wrap context inside of what I want to use the context in of UserContext.Provider
*
