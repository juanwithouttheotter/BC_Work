what we did well
    We Worked together and communicated
    We set goals to accomplish
    We resolved issues together
    
    

what didnt go well
    We didn't divide up the work well with skillsets in mind
    We took spent too much time on the simpler code and little time on the code that had more complex logic
    We didn't always ask for help when we needed it from out teammates. 
    Starting at the backend.
    

Moving forward
     We could better identify each others strengths and weaknesses.
     Ask for help when needed.
     We could be more vocal
