    //you calling the the function is context. inside out is now equal to the function outside.
    //So when invoking insideOut, 2 is sent into the outside function which then gives x aka 1 and y 2 added together equates to 3;
    //1 + y
    // What does this return?
    insideOut(2);
    //3

    // Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined.
    // How does insideOut have access to x?
    console.log("The value of 'x' outside 'outside()' is: " + x);
    // insideOut does not have access to x, only the output of 1+y, which then inputs 2 making it 1+2;
